## [Description]
I built a 2-player Connect 4 game with the guidance of this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ARsthVnCTg 

I improved upon the tutorial by the following:
- determining a tie 
- signaling whose turn it is 
- designing a try-again button
## [Future Updates]
- Implement a timer 
- Implement playing against an Al (one-player mode)
